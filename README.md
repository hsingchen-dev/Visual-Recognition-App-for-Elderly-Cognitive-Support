An AI-powered mobile–PC integrated application that helps elderly users understand objects, packages, and medicines through image recognition and local LLaMA reasoning — all running offline via local Wi-Fi.

Introduction
In aging societies, many seniors struggle with everyday cognitive difficulties such as:

“What is this product for?”

“Can I eat this? The text is too small to read.”

“This package has only foreign words — is it safe?”

These small but frequent challenges create psychological anxiety, reduce independent living ability, and may even lead to accidental misuse of medicines or food.
To address this issue, SKYNET provides a vision-based cognitive assistance system that explains real-world objects in simple, easy-to-understand language.
Users only need to take a photo — the system automatically analyzes the image using a locally installed LLaMA model on their home PC, evaluates potential health or safety risks, and returns the explanation instantly to their smartphone.
